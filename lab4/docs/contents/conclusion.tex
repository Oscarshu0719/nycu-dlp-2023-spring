\chapter{Conclusion}
\indent
	After training ResNets, I found that the model without pretrained does not work, even if 
	the accuracy is about \textbf{73\%}. With pretrained weights, the model has learned some 
	visual patterns, which is maybe from another dataset, and the knowledge can be used to solve this task.
	Thus, pretrained models are really useful.
