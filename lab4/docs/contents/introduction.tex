	This task is to solve diabetic retinopathy detection problem by ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models. 
	Additionally, compare two models, one with pretrained weight and the other without pretrained. \\
	The dataset includes 5 classes, 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 0: No diabetic retinopathy.
		\item 1: Mild.
		\item 2: Moderate.
		\item 3: Severe.
		\item 4: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
	\end{itemize}
