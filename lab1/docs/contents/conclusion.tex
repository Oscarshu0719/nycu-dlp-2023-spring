\chapter{Conclusion}
\indent
	After trying so many experiments, I found some patterns for this task: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \code{Adam} optimizer is \textbf{much better} than \code{SGD} optimizer.
		\item \code{LeakyReLU} is \textbf{a little better} than \code{ReLU}.
		\item Learning rate $10^{-2}$ is great, too large or too small is hard to converge.
		\item \textbf{Larger} dimension of hidden layers converge faster.
	\end{itemize}
