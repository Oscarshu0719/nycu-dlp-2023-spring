	This task is to build a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers to classify 2 datasets which each has 2 classes (See Figure \ref{network}). \\
	One dataset can be approximately seperated by an $y = x$ linear classifier. 
	The other dataset is like an X, the data points on the $y = x$ line belong to the same class, 
	and data points on the $xy = 1$ line belong to the other class (See Figure \ref{datasets}).
