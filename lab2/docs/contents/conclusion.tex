	After this experiment, I found that \textbf{patterns} play an important role in this task.\\
	With original 4 patterns, the average reached 2048-tile percentage is only about \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{90\%}} after 350K iterations training.
	However, with another 4 patterns, totally 8 patterns are used, it reaches about \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{95\%}}.
