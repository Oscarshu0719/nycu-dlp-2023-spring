> **There are still some unresolved bugs.**

- Lab 1: back-propagation.
  - Back-propagation part is implemented exclusively for settings with **2 hidden layers**. 
  Not too hard to generalize to arbitrary hidden layers.
- Lab 2: Temporal Difference Learning.
- Lab 3: EEG classification.
- Lab 4: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection.
- Lab 5: Conditional VAE For Video Prediction.
- Assignment 1: Prove DDPM.
- Lab 6: DQN and DDPG.
  - *BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4* is NOT correctly implemented.
- Lab 7: Letâ€™s Play DDPM.
  - There are some unresolved bugs in the DDPM model.
