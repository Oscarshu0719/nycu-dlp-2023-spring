\chapter{Conclusion}
\indent
	After trying so many experiments, I found some patterns for this task: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \code{Adam} optimizer is \textbf{better} than \code{SGD} optimizer.
		\item \code{ReLU} and \code{LeakyReLU} are \textbf{better} than \code{ELU} for EEGNet, but similar for DeepConvNet.
		\item EEGNet has better accuracy than DeepConvNet, 
		though DeepConvNet has larger model size (150577) than EEGNet (17874), and
		this may be due to the inappropriate model structure, 
		like number of layers, kernel size, and etc.
	\end{itemize}
