	This task is to implement EEGNet and DeepConvNet models with different activation functions, i.e, 
	\code{ReLU}, \code{LeakyReLU}, and \code{ELU}.
	The goal of this task is to solve EEG classification problem using BCI competition III - IIIb dataset.\\
	BCI Competition III - IIIb dataset includes cued motor imagery with online feedback, which is non-stationary classifier,
	with 2 classes, left hand and right hand, from 3 subjects, 2 classes and 2 bipolar EEG channels.\footnote{Reference: \url{http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IIIb.pdf}}
