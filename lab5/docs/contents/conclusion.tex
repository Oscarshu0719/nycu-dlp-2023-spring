\chapter{Conclusion}
\indent
	Before training, I thought that if we use fixed teacher-forcing ratio 1, 
	the testing PSNR would be worse than training and validation PSNR.
	However, I got an unexpected result, testing PSNR is even higher than best validation PSNR, 
	and also results of both KL annealing modes are similar.
